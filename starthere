##Purpose

Company documentation needs to be in a place where everyone can access it, and it also needs to be democratic. Keeping our docs in GitHub means every team member can comment, edit, and update as needed. The process of editing and approving means that we always have an audit trail and accountability. Let's just say I wanted to change the working hours section of our team charter so that it looked like we only had to work on Wednersday and Thursday. Seems easy if anyone can just go in and edit the doc, right? Not so fast! My change would need to be approved by my team and every team member would get a notification if I made such a change. So instead of me sneaking into the docs, I could bring up at the next team meeting that I think we should look at how many hours we work per week.
